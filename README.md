# macos-catalina-to-iso
This script will create a macos catalina iso file. I have only tested this with a late 2015 macbook pro.
This was intended for creating macos catalina virtual machines in vmware esxi(MUST BE RUNNNIG ON APPLE PRODUCT).

After this script creates the iso file, you can upload it to a vmware datastore and boot from it. Again, the esxi host absolutely must be an apple product. If it is not, the VM probably won't boot at all.
